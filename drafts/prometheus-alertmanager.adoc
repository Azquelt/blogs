= Configuring Prometheus Alertmanager with Open Liberty
Jennifer Cheng <https://github.com/jennifer-c>

Every application needs a strong monitoring system to catch unexpected issues, whether it's an overloaded heap or a slow-responding servlet. MicroProfile Metrics provides the ability to expose metrics for your application. Used in conjunction with the open-source monitoring system link:https://prometheus.io/[Prometheus] and the link:https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/overview/[Prometheus Alertmanager], we can build a strong foundation for monitoring your system and reacting quickly to issues.

Before we start, you should have a Liberty server with the `mpMetrics-2.0` feature enabled to test your Alertmanager configuration.

To learn more about MicroProfile Metrics, check out link:https://openliberty.io/guides/microprofile-metrics.html[this guide.]

== Setting up Prometheus with Open Liberty
. Download link:https://prometheus.io/download/#prometheus[Prometheus] and extract it. (By the way, since you're already there, go ahead and download the Alertmanager as well.)

. Edit the `prometheus.yml` file. Under the `scrape_configs` section, there is already a job configured for Prometheus itself. We need to add one for Open Liberty, which should look something like this:
```
- job_name: 'openliberty'

    scheme: 'https'

    tls_config:
      insecure_skip_verify: true

    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9443']
```
[start=3]
. Run `./prometheus` (or `prometheus.exe` on Windows). When you see the message `Server is ready to receive web requests`, navigate over to `http://localhost:9090` to view the Prometheus web UI.
. To verify that your setup is working, click on `Targets` under `Status` in the navigation bar. You should see your `openliberty` target with the status `UP`.

== Creating Prometheus Alerting Rules
. Make a file called `alert.yml`. Inside that file, you will be creating alerting rules.
Here's an example:
```
groups:
- name: libertyexample
  rules:
  - alert: heapUsageTooHigh
    expr: base_memory_usedHeap_bytes / base_memory_maxHeap_bytes > 0.9
    for: 1m
    labels:
      severity: warning
    annotations:
      summary: "Heap usage is too high"
      description: "{{ $labels.instance }} heap usage is too high"
```
This rule will send an alert called `heapUsageTooHigh` when the PromQL query `base_memory_usedHeap_bytes / base_memory_maxHeap_bytes` is greater than `0.9` (90%) for one minute. (For testing purposes, feel free to change the threshold to something smaller, like 0.05.)

Check out the link:https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/[Querying Prometheus] page to learn more about PromQL queries.
[start=2]
. In the `prometheus.yml` file, add the location of your `alert.yml` file under `rule_files`. If it's not in the same directory as Prometheus, make sure you supply the full path.
. Restart Prometheus. Navigate to `http://localhost:9090` and click on `Alerts` on the navigation bar. You should be able to see your alert.

== Configuring the Prometheus Alertmanager with Slack
Note: you will need a Slack channel to send alerts to, as well as a link:https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks[Slack webhook] for that channel.

. Now that Prometheus is set up with rules for our Liberty server, we can set up the Prometheus Alertmanager. If you haven't already downloaded it, you can do so link:https://prometheus.io/download/#prometheus[here.] Extract it.
. Edit `alertmanager.yml` to add your Slack webhook under `global`. Then, under the `route`, you will see that there is a receiver called `web.hook`. We will be editing this receiver to work with Slack.
. Right under `webhook_configs`, add another field (aligned with `webhook_configs`) called `slack_configs`. It'll look something like this:
```
slack_configs:
- channel: 'prometheus-alertmanager-test'
  title: "{{ range .Alerts }}{{ .Annotations.summary }}\n{{ end }}"
  text: "*Description*: {{ .CommonAnnotations.description }}\n*Severity*: {{ .CommonLabels.severity }}""
```
The `CommonAnnotations` come from your `alert.yml` file. The text is written using the link:https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/[Go templating] system.

[start=4]
. Run `./alertmanager`. The Alertmanager is located at `http://localhost:9093` by default. Since we haven't generated any test data yet, you won't see any alert groups at the moment.

== Receiving Alerts via the Alertmanager
Now that the Alertmanager is set up, we need to configure Prometheus to talk to it.

. In the `prometheus.yml` file inside your Prometheus folder, under `targets`, add `localhost:9093`.
. Restart Prometheus.
. Trigger the alert however you can - with the rule we're using, the easiest way is to change your threshold value to be very low and run your application a few times to use up some of your heap.
. Head over to `http://localhost:9090` and click on Alerts. Your alert should be in the `Pending` or `Firing` state. (Once the alert is in the `Firing` state, you should also be able to see your alert at `http://localhost:9093`.)
. Check your Slack channel to see your message.

== Next Steps
Now that we have a basic configuration of the Prometheus Alertmanager set up, we can play with Prometheus rules to create a more comprehensive alerting system. We can also customize our messages to be more informative by using the Go templating system. Need some inspiration?
